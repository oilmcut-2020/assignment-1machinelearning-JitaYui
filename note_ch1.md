# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.

A more engineering-oriented definition:
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Example of spam filter
Traditional Step:
1.	Consider what spam typically looks like.
2.	Write a detection algorithm.
3.	Test program.

**At Machine Learning, it notices unusually frequent words come up in spam flagged by users, and it starts flagging them without users.**

## Machine Learning is great for:
*	Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach.
*	Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.
*	Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
*	Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
## Examples of Applications
*	Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them.
*	Detecting tumors in brain scans
*	Automatically classifying news articles
*	Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums
*	Summarizing long documents automatically
*	Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant.
*	Forecasting your companyâ€™s revenue next year, based on many performance metrics
*	Making your app react to voice commands
*	Detecting credit card fraud
*	Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a different marketing strategy for each segment.
*	Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful diagram
*	Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past purchases
*	Building an intelligent bot for a game.

# Types of Machine Learning Systems
## Supervised/Unsupervised Learning
* Supervised Learning
  *	The training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.
  *	A typical supervised learning task is classification. 
  *	Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, given a set of features called predictors. This sort of task is called regression.

## NOTE

*In Machine Learning an attribute is a data type, while a feature has several meanings, depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value. Many people use the words attribute and feature interchangeably.*

----
  *	Unsupervised Learning
    * In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.
